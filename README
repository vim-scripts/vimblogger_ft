vimblogger_ft is a simple reStructuredText to Blogger Interface through VIm.

As the name suggest it is a filetype plugin, which helps to create blog articles in rsST format and send them to blog site. It also provides commands for preview in browser and delete articles.

Module for communication was written in Python. So, VIm has to be compiled with +python.

Other requirements:
  - Python (tested with version 2.6, should also work with other versions prior 3.0)
  - gdata http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client
  - docutils http://docutils.sourceforge.net
  - pygments http://pygments.org (optional)

See documentation for detailed description.
